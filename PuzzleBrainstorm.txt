Block Pulling - Players can only drag matching colour blocks and cannot attack while in block mode
	- blocks can activate machinery
	- one potential puzzle: block is the only thing btw. main room and enemy spawn, but need to bring block to trigger area in order to progress.
		- so moving it allows enemies into the room of all but the colour of the block
	- block in place unlocks next room and stops the enemies spawning (but players still have to deal with living ones)
	- could have capture the flag like segments where enemies try to bring the object back
ADVANCED BLOCK PULLING: pipe with 2 ends. Anyone can grab either side, but need to manouver through an area where movement is limited by colour

Colour doors - lock out all but the permitted colour -> areas where players will have to do things alone, or in limited groups.
 	i.e. Key assembly: Each player must collect a key fragment from their section, and once all have their fragments a door is unlocked.

Protect the X challenge:
	- keep enemies from destroying an X (could be a tower, could be a statue, could be an orb etc.) for a certain amount of time, then clear.

Combination of Levers : press in a certain order/pattern -> Different ways to reveal order: hidden in the level?

Class related puzzles: Long range characters needed to shoot targets, maybe healer needed to revive something (plant?) Melee person kick down door? Levitate an object (Mage)
	- would have to make sure proper team comp. to include ELSE do not include in the generation

Channel X challenge: 'give up' one player to 'channel' while other players must do some task (i.e. player blue stands on pressure plate to turn on energy while all other players do an
						energy based puzzle. The puzzle can't move if nobody is channeling)


Literal Puzzle : put together pieces -> players can only pick up pieces that match their colour : can be combined with levers to give solve order.
